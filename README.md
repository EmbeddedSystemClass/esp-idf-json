# esp-idf-json
Example of JSON Serialize and Deserialize in ESP-IDF

ESP-IDF can use JSON components as standard.   
But the documentation is very poor.   
The official documentation for the JSON component is [here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/components/json/README).

[Here](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON/blob/master/tests/readme_examples.c) is a sample by Dave Gamble.

# How to use
```
git clone https://github.com/nopnop2002/esp-idf-json
cd esp-idf-json/json-basic
make flash monitor
```
